== PROJECT: Media Socializer

---

== Overview

Media Socializer is a desktop address book application used to help social media users to keep track of all the social media platforms they are using. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to search on all platforms*
** What it does: allows user to perform the search action on all the social media platforms available with a single command
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can do search on the application instead of going to the individual social media platform and repeatedly perform the search.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires interactions with all the social media platform available, each with different interfaces. Thus the implementation involve a lot of third party libraries, and this makes the implementation challenging.
** Credits: _{Update the social media library used here}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a findtag command that allows the user to find persons whose tags contain the input keywords.
