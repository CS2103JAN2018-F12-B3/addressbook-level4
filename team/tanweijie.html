+== Overview</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>+
+Media Socializer is a desktop address book application used to help social media users to keep track of all the social media platforms they are using. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.</p>

+== Summary of contributions</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>+
+* <strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to undo/redo previous commands PLACEHOLDER</strong>
+<strong> What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
+</strong> Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
+<strong> Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
+</strong> Credits: <em>{mention the social media libraries used here}</em></p>

<p>+
+* <strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a sort command that allows the user to alphabetically sort the people in the list.</p>
